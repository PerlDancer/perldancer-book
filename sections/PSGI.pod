=head2 PSGI

Z<PSGI>

In 2009, when the first versions of Dancer were published, a little revolution
embraced the Perl web development scene, with an abstraction layer named PSGI.

Before PSGI, all web frameworks needed to implement different deployment
solutions for their users: CGI, FastCGI, standalone servers, etc. The same code
was written by each framework and there wasn't a standard way for deploying a web
application.

With PSGI, all web frameworks are able to rely on it for deployment needs, it
allows them to forget about I<how the application is deployed> and let them
focus on I<how the application is written>.

A Dancer application is a PSGI application, which means that it can be deployed
virtually anywhere: wherever PSGI is supported, Dancer can run.

This is something less to think about, and more time and brainpower spent on
the stuff that matters: what your application does.
