=head2 A DSL for Web Development

Z<DSL>

Dancer is a web microframework for Perl. It's also often referred to as a
Domain-Specific Language (or DSL) for web development. As a matter of fact, when
you look at Dancer, the first thing you see is the set of keywords it provides:
C<get>, C<param>, C<session>, C<template>, C<cookie>... All these are atomic
helpers designed to do one simple web-related thing. We could see Dancer as a
small language for describing a web application, actually it's very close to
that.

In the same spirit as with Perl itself, the core is meant to be kept as small as
possible and should be complete enough to allow all possible extensions to occur
in the ecosystem. Perl hackers will recognize here the philosophy of Perl and
its CPAN, Dancer mimics that with pride.
